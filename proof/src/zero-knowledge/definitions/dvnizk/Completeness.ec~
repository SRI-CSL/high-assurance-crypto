  Completness security definition for designated verifier non-interactive zero-knowledge proof
  (DVNIZKP) protocols. 

  This file formalizes the completeness cryptographic experience for DVNIZK protocols. 
  Informally, the game takes as input a witness and a statement, which is then feed to the
  protocol. The final output of the game is bit *b*, corresponding to the verifier decision.

  The game is parameterized by a randomness generator procedure, whose goal is to provide
  the appropriate random values to both the prover and the verifier. 

  The completeness theorem can be written as follows:
    forall (R <: Rand_t) (w : witness_t) (x : statement_t),
      relation w x => [ Completeness(R).main(w, x) : true ==> res ]

      **gen** function that takes no input and produces both the prover and verifier randomness *)

        b <- (snd y);
