synopsis: "EVOCrypt: EasyCrypt Verified OCaml Cryptographic Library"
description:
  "EVOCrypt includes verified implementations of modern cryptographic algorithms including MPC protocols (BGW and Maurer), commitment schemes (SHA3-based), ZK protocols (MPC-in-the-Head and LPZK) and OLE/VOLE protocols based on additively homomorphic encryption schemes (Paillier-based OLE/VOLE). All implementations were developed and proven secure in EasyCrypt and were then extracted to OCaml using CoCoCrypt"
