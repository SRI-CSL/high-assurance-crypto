(**
  Arithmetic circuit definition, where the actual gates that form the circuit, are modeled as an 
  inductive tree, where the output of the circuit is given by the gate at the root of the tree, 
  nodes correspond to arithmetic gates, and the input and constant gates form the leaves.

  We choice to formalize the representation of gates via an inductive tree to reduce the effort
  of the verification process, since we could use induction techniques in our proof scripts. 
  However, we understand that this is not the most suitable format if one is targeting efficiency.

  Our arithmetic circuit definition is a direct instantiation of the abstract circuit syntax
  disclosed by the *ACircuit.ec* file and should serve as guide for future definitions of other
  types of circuits.
