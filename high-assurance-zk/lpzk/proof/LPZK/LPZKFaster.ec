(**
  First optimization step: reducing extra circuit iterations (**LPZKFaster**). 

  Before extracting OCaml code from our EasyCrypt formalization, we perform a preliminary 
  optimization step that reduces extra circuit iterations made both by the verifier. Following 
  the definition depicted in the *LPZK.ec* file, one can observe that the verifier iterates over 
  the circuit to check that the commitment message is consistent with the circuit and then 
  performs another circuit iteration to generate [f]. Naturally, this party can condense the two 
  circuit iterations into a single one, where [gen_f] now checks the consistency of the 
  commitment while generating [f] at the same time.

  Technically, we will be re-using all types and operators from *LPZK.ec*, except for the [gen_f]
  operation, which we formalize to check the consistency of the commitment message at the same
  time it computes [f]. At the end, the new [gen_f] function will output two values: a boolean -
  indicating if the commitment message is valid - and the [f] data structure - which will only be
  well-formed if the commitment message is valid. We will then show that:
    - if the commitment message is valid, the boolean output of the new [gen_f] function will 
      always be true
    - if the commitment message is valid, both [gen_f] from *LPZK.ec* and the [gen_f] formalized
      here will produce the same [f] data structure
  Armed with these two results, we can prove that the [prove] function has the same observable
  behavior as the one of *LPZK.ec* and, therefore, that the two protocols are equivalent.

  Completeness, soundness and zero knowledge for this new version of LPZK were derived by proving
  that both the original and new versions have the same observable behavior. Informally, we prove
  that both the new prove operator will produce the same decision as the reference one on all 
  possible inputs. This allowed us to prove that: 
    i. the completeness game of the new LPZK version has the same probability of the completeness
       game of the reference LPZK version; 
    ii. the soundness game of the new LPZK version has the same probability of the soundness game
        of the reference LPZK version; and 
    iii. that the real zero knowledge game of the new LPZK version is indistinguishable from the 
         real game of the reference LPZK version and, therefore, the same simulator can be used 
         to prove zero knowledge.
